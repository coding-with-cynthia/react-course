## Step 2: Adding components

Let's add a child component and give our app a header. At the end of the step, your app should like the following:

![App with header](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25253905/61294086-eb352e80-a789-11e9-96ab-8b6cb09b3791.png)

### :keyboard: Activity: Add an `h3` component to `src/App.jsx`

1. On line 92 in `src/App.jsx`, replace the line where it says to replace with this header component:

    ```jsx
    <h3 className="Box-title d-flex flex-justify-center">GradeBook</h3>
    ```
2. Inside your repository folder in the terminal, run your code: `npm start`
3. Save your code
4. Commit and push your code to the `changes` branch:
    ```
    git add src/App.jsx
    git commit -m "add a header component"
    git push -u origin changes
    ```

    After I detect a push, I will respond.
