## A Date with Data - State Variables

So now, we learned how to pass data to components, but let's talk about the data itself.

There are two types of data: **static data** and **dynamic data**.

Static data doesn't change, hence the name static. Things like a title on a page or the name of a button would be static data.

Dynamic data, on the other hand, is data that does change because we can change it by adding an item to the list. Our list of assignments would be considered dynamic data. But how do we deal with dynamic data in React? We can't just dump it in a component, because how will we tell the data to change?
