## Step 7 -  Create an `addStudent` method

Now that we see how it works with assignments, let's try it with students! We will create an `addStudent` method to add students the same way we add assignments.

### :keyboard: Activity: Import a List component to `App.jsx`

1. Create a method called `addStudent` below the comment. `addStudent` should take `studentName` as a parameter and then concat that `studentName` to the end of `students` list that we created earlier. 
2. Run your code with `npm start` to make sure there are no errors.
3. Commit and push your code to the `changes` branch:
    ```
    git add src/App.jsx
    git commit -m "import list component"
    git push origin changes
    ```

    I'll respond after you push.
