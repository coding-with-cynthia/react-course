## Step 7: Create a method

Now that we see how it works with assignments, let's try it with students! We will create an `addStudent` method to add students the same way we add assignments.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create an `addStudent` method in `src/App.jsx`

1. On line 37, create a method called `addStudent` below the comment
   - `addStudent` should take `studentName` as a parameter 
   - `addStudent` should concat `studentName` to the end of `students` list that we created earlier 
    - Hint: You can copy the same format for the `addAssignment` method
2. Save your code
3. To run your code, move inside your repo folder in your terminal and run `npm start`
4. Exit the process in your terminal using `Ctrl + C`
5. Commit and push your code to the `changes` branch:
    ```
    git add src/App.jsx
    git commit -m "create addStudents method"
    git push
    ```
