### :keyboard: Activity: Uncomment the grades conditional in `src/App.jsx`

1. Uncomment the conditional statment for our `grades` tab
2. Save your code
3. To run your code, move inside your repo folder in your terminal and run `npm start`
4. Exit the process using `Ctrl + C`
5. Commit and push your code to the `changes` branch:
