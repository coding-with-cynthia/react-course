## Step 9 - Uncomment the Grades Section 

LAST THING! Let's get our grades working! At the end of this activity, your code should now be able to add assignments, students, and grades! You will be done!


### :keyboard: Activity: Uncomment the grades conditional in `App.jsx`

1. Uncomment the conditional statment for our `grades` tab
2. Save your code
3. To run your code, move inside your repo folder in your terminal and run `npm start`
4. Exit the process using `Ctrl + C`
5. Commit and push your code to the `changes` branch:
    ```
    git add src/App.jsx
    git commit -m "import list component"
    git push origin changes
    ```

    I'll respond after you push.
