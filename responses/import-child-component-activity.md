### Import a Child Component

Navigate to `List.jsx`. You'll see that we made our own component, `List`. 

Let's go ahead and import that component.

At the top of `App.jsx`, replace the line with

```js
import List from "./List";
```

Scroll down for the next step.

### Push your code
Let's push your code to GitHub

Run the following lines inside your repo folder in your terminal.

```
git add src/App.jsx
git commit -m "import list component"
git push origin changes
```

I'll respond after you push.
