### Code Explanation

Let's take a look at what this code means. Basically, what it is saying is that when we click the `Assignments` button, the list for assignments will be assigned to the variable `tabChoice`. In our `render` method, we see that `tabChoice` is rendered.

But how do we specialize the `List` for our assignments? This where our props come into play. We create properties such as `placeholder`, and `currList`. We then assign values to them.
