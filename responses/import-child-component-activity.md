## Step 3 -  Import a Child Component

Navigate to `List.jsx`. You'll see that we made our own component, `List`. 

Let's go ahead and import that component.

### :keyboard: Activity: Import a List component to `App.jsx`

1. At the top of `App.jsx`, replace the line with

    ```js
    import List from "./List";
    ```
2. Commit and push your code to the `changes` branch:
    ```
    git add src/App.jsx
    git commit -m "import list component"
    git push origin changes
    ```

    I'll respond after you push.
