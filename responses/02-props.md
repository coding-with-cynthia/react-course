## How to Talk to your Child - Props

Now, let's discuss how we can reuse the same component with different properties.

That might sound a little confusing, but let's take a look. Go to our final [solution](https://githubtraining.github.io/react-solution/) and add some assignments along with students. You might start to notice that both lists look the same but with different values. In fact, both lists are the same component!

However, how do we pass different values to a component? We do so by passing **properties to the component**, otherwise known as **props**. 

We will get a little deeper into that in a bit. 

### Props used for Assignments and Students Pages

Take a look at our final solution for our assignments and students page above. You'll see that they look really similar. The lists are the same component, but with different values. We need to learn to pass different values to the same components.
