That might sound a little confusing, but let's take a look. Go to our final solution and add some assignments along with students. You might start to notice that both lists look the same but with different values. In fact, both lists are the same component!

Hmmm, but how do we pass different values to a component? We do so by passing properties to the component, otherwise known as props. 

We will get a little deeper into that in a bit.
