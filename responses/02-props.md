## How to Talk to your Child - Props

Alright, so we established that components are awesome, but what about reusable components with different properties? 

That might sound a little confusing, but let's take a look. Go to our final solution and add some assignments along with students. You might start to notice that both lists look the same but with different values. In fact, both lists are the same component!

Hmmm, but how do we pass different values to a component? We do so by passing properties to the component, otherwise known as props. 

We will get a little deeper into that in a bit.

Take a look at our final solution for our assignments and students page above. You'll see that they look really similar. The lists are the same component, but with different values. We need to learn to pass different values to the same components.
