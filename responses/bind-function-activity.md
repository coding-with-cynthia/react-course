### Step 8 - Binding a function

Also, since we created a method that changes the a state variable, we have to bind it to our class, so that when we call it, we know what method to reference.

Go ahead and uncomment the line to bind `addStudent` to `App`.

### :keyboard: Activity: Bind `addStudent` to `App`

1. Uncomment the line to bind `addStudent` to `App`.
2. Run your code with `npm start` to make sure there are no errors.
3. Commit and push your code to the `changes` branch:
    ```
    git add src/App.jsx
    git commit -m "import list component"
    git push origin changes
    ```

    I'll respond after you push.
