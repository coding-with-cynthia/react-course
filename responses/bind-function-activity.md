### Bind the function

Also, since we created a method that changes the a state variable, we have to bind it to our class, so that when we call it, we know what method to reference.

Go ahead and uncomment this line.

### Run your code
Run your code with `npm start` to make sure there are no errors.


### Push your code

```
git add src/App.jsx
git commit -m "using students state variable and setting state"
git push origin changes

```

I'll respond after you push.
